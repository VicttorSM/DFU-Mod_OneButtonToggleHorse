# One Button Toggle Horse

**One Button Toggle Horse** is a mod for **Daggerfall Unity** that allows players to mount or dismount their horse with a single key press. The default key is "G," but you can customize this in the mod settings.

## Features

- **Quick Horse Toggle**: Press a single button to instantly mount or dismount your horse.
- **Configurable Key Binding**: Customize the toggle key through the mod settings for convenience.

## Installation

1. **Download the mod files** from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/843).
2. Use the **Vortex mod manager** for easy installation, or manually extract the contents into your `DaggerfallUnity_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods` folder.
3. Optionally, configure the toggle key under **Mod Settings** if you prefer a different key than "G."

## Usage

Simply press **"G"** (or your configured key) in-game to toggle between mounted and dismounted states (make sure to be somewhere the horse can be mounted).
